Swapping tokens on Invariant is easy, fast, and cost-effective. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

1. Navigate to the **Swap** page.

A modal will appear where you can choose a specific token by either entering its name or selecting one from the list. Additionally, you can add a token by clicking the **plus**  button and providing its token address. In this example, we're swapping from SOL to USDC.
