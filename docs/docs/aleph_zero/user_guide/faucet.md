To be able to claim an airdrop from the Invariant platform, we need to have TZERO (Testnet AZERO) to pay the network fee for the transaction. Therefore, we need to go through two steps to receive the airdrop.


# Aleph Zero Faucet

Open your web browser and navigate to the [Aleph Zero Faucet page](https://faucet.test.azero.dev/).
