## What is ALPH?

ALPH is the native token of the Alephium blockchain. Users do not need to wrap ALPH to access their assets. This allows for direct and simplified management of ALPH tokens within the ecosystem.

## How to create pool to ALPH?

The Invariant Protocol enables token exchanges within the official Alephium's [Fungible Token Standard](https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/standards/fungible-tokens/#fungible-token-standard). To interact with pools or swaps where the input token is ALPH, the native cryptocurrency of Alephium, no additional wrapping is required. ALPH can be directly deposited into a pool or used in a swap. Similarly, when withdrawing tokens or conducting swaps where ALPH is the output token, no unwrapping is necessary.
